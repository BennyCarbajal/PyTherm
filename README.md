#PyTherm

> Small utility to get hardware temperature with Python 3

##Installation
**Warning Windows Only!**

This utility requires the  Python.NET package to work, so go ahead and install it by running:

    pip install pythonnet

Once this requirement is met and you have already downloaded the PyTherm files you can execute the pytherm.py as **both admin and a regular user** (Yes, you may get different results):

    python pytherm.py

The output as an administrator should be something similar to:

![Pytherm as Admin](https://alpha.scishift.com/img/pytherm_admin.png "Pytherm as Admin")

While running it as a regular user will output something similar to this:
![PyTherm as a regular user](https://alpha.scishift.com/img/pytherm_user.png "PyTherm as a regular user")
